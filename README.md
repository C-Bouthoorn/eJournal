Canvas VLE integration

During the first and second years of the Bachelor Informatics at the University of Amsterdam, students follow a course called PAV (practicum academische vaardigheden or practicum academic competencies). One part of the PAV course is the colloquium journal; students are required to attend events related to their field of study and report on their experiences. Each event can be worth one or more points and students are required to acquire at least ten points by the end of their second year of study. The students' reports are evaluated by a tutor and assigned points on a regular basis.
